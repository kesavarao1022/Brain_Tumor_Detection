# Brain_Tumor_Detection
This project uses the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8) deep learning model to detect and localize brain tumors in medical imaging (e.g., MRI scans). Leveraging the speed and accuracy of YOLOv8, our model identifies tumor regions in real-time with bounding boxes, aiding in faster diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
